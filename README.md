# BanimodeWebsite
This project was generated with Angular version 12.2.2. Its Ui/Ux is based on the real website banimode.com, but the whole coding and styling are done by me. This project consists of Banimode homepage, productpage and login box, which their functionality, such as unique data displaying, buttons, links, etc work well. Login authentication is handled based on the real website standards and throws relevant error or success message. Using Sass, I tried my best to style the project similar to the real design.
